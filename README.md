# SOGL
A very weakly typed language, meaning that every function will do something for all types of input.  
For example, 05AB1E has a function `u` for uppercasing and `Ã®` for ceiling, but SOGL has one for both - `U`.  
You'll never need to uppercase a number and take the ceiling of a string, will you?  
This makes the language very complex, but makes many more free characters available.  
If anything, then kolmogorov-complexity is the languages strong side.  

note: this language is very much in developement, and can, and probably will change a lot in the future, so if used, always keep the version number (or the last commit) the program was made for.

### To run a program, 

- download the P5Parser

- either 1)
  - in `/data/p.sogl` paste the code of the program
  - run the Processing sketch

- or 2)
  - export the processing sketch
  - run it with an argument of the path to the file containing the program
- the output will be in the file `output.txt` and STDOUT.
